# tomatoplantdiseaseidentifier
Hello Guys,
I have created one project using Deep Learning which will help farmers to identify which disease is caused to their tomato plant.
There are total 9 types of diseases which will spoil tomato plant so it is difficult for farmers to identify which one among the 9 diseases is harming their crop.
so I've created one application were the user just have to upload the image of the tomato leaf and it will tell us which disease is damaging their crop.
The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks and the accuracy of the model is above 90%.
The model is deployed on web framework FLASK.
